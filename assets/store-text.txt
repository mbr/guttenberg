Lost track of your sources? Guttenberg is an extension written for Google Chrome. It allows you to select text on a webpage and copy it to the clipboard. Quotation marks and a footnote referring the source will automagically be added.

Get that Ph.D. and keep it, too!

Note: After installing the extension, reload pages that you had open for it to work.

If you are having trouble with the Google Extension gallery, you can download this extension as well from https://github.com/mbr/guttenberg.
