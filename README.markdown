Lost track of your sources?
===========================
Guttenberg is an extension written for Google Chrome. It allows you to select text on a webpage and copy it to the clipboard. Quotation marks and a footnote referring the source will automagically be added.

Get that Ph.D. and keep it, too!

How to install
==============
Install it from the Chrome App Store: <https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gclcaahfkiaicchpdenbogmchbhfbnok>

After the installation, the extension will be active for all tabs you open after that - so reload, if you want to use it on a tab you already had open. Then, simply copy something to the clipboard and paste it elsewhere.
