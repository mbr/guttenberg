Lost track of your sources?
===========================
Guttenberg is an extension written for Google Chrome. It allows you to select text on a webpage and copy it to the clipboard. Quotation marks and a footnote referring the source will automagically be added.

Get that Ph.D. and keep it, too!

How to install
==============
To install, simply click on this link: <https://github.com/downloads/mbr/guttenberg/guttenberg.crx> or select "guttenberg.crx" from the big "Download" button above.

After the installation, the extension will be active for all tabs you open after that - so reload, if you want to use it on a tab you already had open. Then, simply copy something to the clipboard and paste it elsewhere.
